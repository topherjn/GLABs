four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. we are met on a great battle field of that war. we come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. this we may, in all propriety do.
