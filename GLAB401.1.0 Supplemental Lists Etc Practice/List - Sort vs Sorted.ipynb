    "The difference between `sort()` method and `sorted()` function in Python is as follows:\n",
    "2024.01.25 vlb\n",
    "1. `sort()` method:\n",
    "   - `sort()` is a method that can be applied directly to a list (or other mutable sequences) in Python.\n",
    "   - It sorts the list in-place, meaning it modifies the original list and does not return a new one.\n",
    "   - Example: `my_list.sort()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `sorted()` function:\n",
    "   - `sorted()` is a built-in Python function that takes an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string) as an argument and returns a new sorted list.\n",
    "   - It does not modify the original iterable, but instead, it creates a sorted copy of it.\n",
    "   - Example: `sorted_list = sorted(my_list)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `sort()` modifies the list in-place, while `sorted()` creates a new sorted list without modifying the original iterable. Choose the one that suits your needs based on whether you want to sort the original list or create a sorted copy."

    "1. Method:\n",
    "   - In object-oriented programming, a \"method\" is a function that is associated with an object or a class.\n",
    "   - Methods are defined within a class and operate on the data (attributes) of that class.\n",
    "   - They can access and modify the object's state and are typically invoked on an instance of the class using the dot notation.\n",
    "   - In the context of `sort()` method, it is associated with a list object, and you call it on the list directly, like `my_list.sort()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function:\n",
    "   - A \"function\" is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be defined independently of any class or object.\n",
    "   - Functions can take arguments, perform operations, and return results.\n",
    "   - They are not tied to any specific object or class and can be used globally in the code.\n",
    "   - In the context of `sorted()` function, it is not bound to any specific object, and you call it independently, like `sorted(my_list)`.\n"
